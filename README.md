# Color Based Auto Clicker

An auto clicker tool that allows users to automate clicks when cursor is above a target color. The Auto Clicker is fully customizable and includes features like a toggleable on/off switch, color detection, and customizable hotkeys for toggle and quit actions.

## Features

- **Color Based**: This Autoclicker runs off a target color that you choose via RGB, when ever your mouse hovers over the target color it clicks
- **Toggleable**: An Autoclicker wouldnt be very practical if it weren't toggelable. So it has that feature! And you can customize the toggle button.
- **Themes**: In the interface you can choose between dark and light to soothe your eyes!
- **Compatiable**: This Autoclicker is compatiable with both Windows and macOS but mained for Windows (CONTACT FOR MAC ISSUES)
